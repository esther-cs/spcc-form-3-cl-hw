### T2_Ex1: Maximum and Minimum
Part 1: Ask the user to input an integer (target) between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). Then use Python
random number generator to generate random values, and count the number of values
generated until the target first appears (i.e. the first time the random value generated is the
same as the target). Let's call this count the waiting length.

Part 2: The waiting length in part 1 in each trial can be different because of the randomness. Find out
the minimum and maximum waiting length among 10000 trials (for the same target). Sample
output.
