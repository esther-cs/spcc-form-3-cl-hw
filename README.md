### T1_Ex1: Introduction to Python
Part 1: Calculate the roots of quadratic equation

Part 2: Heron's Formula

### T1_Ex2: Conditional Statements

Part 1: A supermarket is offering a special sale: 20% off with purchases of $150 or above; 10% off
with purchases of $100 or above and 5% off with purchases of $50 or above.
Ask the user to input the total purchase price and store it into the variable total_price.
Write an if-statement to calculate the discounted price and store it into a variable
discount_price. Then print out the discounted price to the user.

Part 2: Better Quadratic Solver

### T2_Ex1: Maximum and Minimum
Part 1: Ask the user to input an integer (target) between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). Then use Python
random number generator to generate random values, and count the number of values
generated until the target first appears (i.e. the first time the random value generated is the
same as the target). Let's call this count the waiting length.

Part 2: The waiting length in part 1 in each trial can be different because of the randomness. Find out
the minimum and maximum waiting length among 10000 trials (for the same target). Sample
output.

### T2_Ex2: Selection Sort
After reading the data, add Python code to sort the data according to
(a) User ID
(b) Age
(c) Height
In each case, print the median values after the sorting is done.

### T2_Ex3: Functions and Selection Sort

### T2_Ex4: Functions, Selection Sort and Searching
